### Data Structure & Algorithms

**Written in C**

Apply basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting and dynamic programming to solve programming challenges.

Apply various data structures such as stack, queue, hash table, priority queue, binary search tree, graph and string to solve programming challenges.

Apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces.

Solve complex programming challenges using advanced techniques: maximum flow, linear programming, approximate algorithms, SAT-solvers, streaming.
